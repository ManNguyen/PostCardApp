# Post Card Application

This application demonstrate how to use **JWT based authentication** in Single Page Application.

## Details

The purpose of this Post Card Applications is to sell "proprietary" sweet flower pictures to use as post card. 
There are 4 flower pictures stored in the server, and to access to those pictures, users have to Register then Login

JWT token is handle in the Front End using "Angular/Service/AuthenticateService.js", and handle in the Back End using "Service/TokenServices" and [TokenAuthenticateFilterAttribute]

## Built With

* [AngularJS 1.x](https://angularjs.org/) - Javascript Framework for Single Page Application
* [Bootstrap3](http://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework
* [ui - router](https://ui-router.github.io/) - Used to route pages
* [ngSanitize](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngSanitize) - Sanitize module for AngularJS
* [ASP.Net 4.6](https://angularjs.org/) Server Coding
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) Database

## Notes

* The Pages #/PostCard is secured in Front End and can be bypassed, but the WebAPI that actually serve pictures is secured in the Back-End via TokenFilterAttribute
* I'm fully aware that I stored the password to the database without hash and it should never happen in production state (even at gun point), I'll get the hash algorithm for the password in this weekend.  .
